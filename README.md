# 🧠 Grounding - Rewire Your Brain

A mindfulness and grounding web application based on neuroplasticity principles for managing stress, anxiety, and emotional regulation.

## About

Grounding is an interactive web application that provides evidence-based grounding techniques to help users stay present, reduce anxiety, and develop better emotional regulation through neuroplasticity-based practices. This app is inspired by concepts from neuroscience research on rewiring the brain through consistent mindful practice.

## Features

### 🎯 Four Core Grounding Exercises

1. **5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Technique**
   - Uses all five senses to anchor you in the present moment
   - Step-by-step guided experience
   - Perfect for acute anxiety or stress

2. **Box Breathing**
   - Rhythmic breathing pattern (4-4-4-4)
   - Visual circle guide that expands and contracts
   - Calms the nervous system
   - Can be practiced anywhere

3. **Body Scan Meditation**
   - Progressive awareness of physical sensations
   - Guided journey through body parts
   - Promotes deep relaxation
   - Builds mind-body connection

4. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**
   - Systematic tensing and releasing of muscle groups
   - Teaches difference between tension and relaxation
   - Effective for physical stress symptoms
   - Rewires stress response over time

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Choose an exercise from the home screen
3. Follow the guided instructions
4. Practice regularly for best results

### Recommended Practice

- **Daily**: 5-10 minutes of any exercise
- **During Stress**: Use 5-4-3-2-1 or Box Breathing
- **Before Sleep**: Body Scan or PMR
- **Build Habit**: Same time each day for neuroplasticity benefits

### Best Practices

- Find a quiet, comfortable space
- Use headphones for better focus (optional)
- Practice consistently for lasting brain changes
- Be patient and non-judgmental with yourself

## The Science Behind Grounding

### Neuroplasticity

The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Regular practice of grounding exercises can:

- Strengthen neural pathways for calm responses
- Reduce automatic stress reactions
- Improve emotional regulation
- Enhance present-moment awareness

### Why These Techniques Work

1. **Sensory Grounding (5-4-3-2-1)**: Interrupts anxiety spirals by engaging the thinking brain
2. **Controlled Breathing**: Activates parasympathetic nervous system (rest & digest)
3. **Body Awareness**: Builds interoception and mind-body connection
4. **Progressive Relaxation**: Teaches nervous system to release tension on command
